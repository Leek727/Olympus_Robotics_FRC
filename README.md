# Olympus Robotics 4982
## Purpose
Github repo for code and documentation for FRC team 4982.

## Folders

 Each folder contains the WPILib code for that particular year. The folder is named after whatever we decided to call the robot that year. There is a `gradlew` file that allows you to upload to the RoboRio and will theoretically automatically handle dependancies.
